The Code is written python.

Usage : python3 Networks.py -i 1 -m 1 -n 1 -f 0.1 -s 0.9999 -T 1000 -o f

This file outputs two images

1) plot between congestion window size(CW) vs update Number
2) plot between congestion window size(CW) vs Rounds

Also I am adding Generation file which generates 32 images of all combinations in one step.
